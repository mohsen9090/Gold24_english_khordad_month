        <h4>پاسخ نمونه (برای سوال 5):</h4> 
        <p>Introduction:<br> The preference for 
        foreign films over local productions is a 
        complex issue that affects many 
        countries' cultural industries.</p> 
        <p>Body Paragraph 1:<br> People often 
        prefer foreign films because: - Higher 
        production quality and special effects - 
        More diverse storylines and themes - 
        Exposure to different cultures and 
        perspectives - Established reputation of 
        major film industries</p> <p>Body 
        Paragraph 2:<br> Government support is 
        crucial because: - Helps maintain 
        cultural identity - Creates local job 
        opportunities - Develops domestic talent 
        - Improves production quality over 
        time</p> <p>Conclusion:<br> While foreign 
        films have their appeal, government 
        support for local film industries is 
        essential for cultural preservation and 
        economic growth.</p> <div class="tips">

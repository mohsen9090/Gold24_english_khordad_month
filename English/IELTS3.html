    <div class="answer"> <h4>نمونه پاسخ (60 
        ثانیه):</h4> <p>"I recently completed my 
        first 5K run, which was quite challenging 
        as I'd never been a runner before. The 
        main difficulty was building stamina - I 
        could barely run for 5 minutes when I 
        started.</p>
        
        <p>I followed a gradual training plan: • 
        Started with walk-run intervals • 
        Increased distance weekly • Practiced 3 
        times per week • Used a fitness app to 
        track progress</p>
        
        <p>The achievement felt incredible 
        because I pushed past my comfort zone and 
        proved to myself that consistent effort 
        pays off."</p> <div class="tips">
